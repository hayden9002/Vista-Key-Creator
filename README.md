# Vista-Key-Creator
I want to know how the DVD installer for windows vista knows how the key is valid. 

I have removed files untill only the key checkign works. <br>
Thats what the ISO is<br>

All i need is with your help, to find out how the DVD can check the keys<br>

Thats it!

Download the ISO and look in it, i belive the "install.wim" holds the answers!

Good luck! :)
