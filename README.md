# Vista-Key-Creator
I want to know how the DVD installer for windows vista knows how the key is valid. 

I had the idea to remove files from a disk image until ONLY the key checking works.
This seems to work really well.

If you want to help take the most recent ISO and remove a file. USe anyburn its free!
Next try it in a virtual machine (or real hardware).
If it still loads and you can get to the product key screen, good!
Try a fake key (22222-22222-22222-22222-22222) if it says "no". good
Try a real key, if it takes you to the lisense page that means it works!.
After publish you findings to the gitpage!
