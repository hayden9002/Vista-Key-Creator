# Vista-Key-Creator
I want to know how the DVD installer for windows vista knows how the key is valid. 

I had the idea to remove files from a disk image until ONLY the key checking works.
This seems to work really well.

If you want to help take the most recent ISO and remove a file. USe anyburn its free!<br>
Next try it in a virtual machine (or real hardware).<br>
If it still loads and you can get to the product key screen, good!<br>
Try a fake key (22222-22222-22222-22222-22222) if it says "no". good<br>
Try a real key, if it takes you to the lisense page that means it works!.<br>
After publish you findings to the gitpage!

(iso is 32 bit)
the ISOs are orginazed by number 

0 is normal staright ISO 
each next one is something removed
1, one thing is removed
2, has number one thing remmoved and something else
